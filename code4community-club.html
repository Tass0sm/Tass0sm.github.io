I
 am part of a team working on a platforming game meant for teaching middle
 schoolers basic programming skills. The president of the club also pulled me
 aside recently and asked me to help lead the group. I'm excited to help out,
 and I might even try to officially join the club's leadership. I haven't had
 this much fun working on a project in a while.</p><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><ul><li>The Entity-Component-System design pattern for games.</li><li>The Phaser 3 game engine.</li></ul></div></div></div><footer><p>Website Created with <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html">Haunt</a></p></footer></body></html>
