 in first place in the OSU division. This was my first CTF competition. I was on
 a team with two other members of the cybersecurity club. I mostly worked on the
 challenges in the reverse engineering category. Out of all participants, I
 solved <a href="https://www.battelle.org/cyber-challenge/headless-horseman">Battelle's headless_horseman challenge</a> first, and I
 enjoyed that challenge the most. I think I will compete in more CTFs.</p><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><ul><li>More experience with reverse engineering in Ghidra</li><li>Using GDB for reverse engineering</li><li>Using the Emacs Grand Unified Debugger interface</li><li>Debugging programs running inside of QEMU</li></ul></div></div></div><footer><p>Website Created with <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html">Haunt</a></p></footer></body></html>
