Unfortunately, it is
somewhat hampered by a tiny community and poor integration into existing
systems. My first experience was becoming enamored by the selling points of
Nix/NixOS and then becoming frustrated when things didn't work.</p><p>Now, I am using the Guix package manager on Arch Linux. I think it works
better and is more enjoyable to use. This is a project by itself, but I just
want to focus on packaging something new for guix, so that one can use it to
replace domain-specific package managers like pip, gem, raco, quicklisp, etc. So
far I've just packaged a python module and two ruby gems.</p><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><ul><li>Some of Guile Scheme</li><li>Basic usage of functional package managers</li><li>Packaging for GNU Guix</li></ul></div></div><footer><p>This website was created using org-mode and haunt.
