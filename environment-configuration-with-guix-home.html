 configuration. Its a pretty nice program made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuj_loxODrOPxSsXDfJmpng">Andrew Tropin</a>. However, setting
it up really emphasized the weakness of normal POSIX shells, just like most of
the interaction between Guix and the shell environment. It is a pain to
configure them for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Tens of spread out files sourced in unclear scenarios.</li><li>Everything is a string. Even structured data like lists.</li><li>Building up lists by prepending and appending is not reproducible and
  error prone.</li><li>Environment variables are always mutable and that can break stuff at any time.</li><li>Shells lack almost everything provided by a real programming language.</li></ul><p>I'd like to fix this with something like scsh or using a lisp REPL for a
shell, but it requires work to depart from the mainstream way of doing things.</p><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><ul><li>Using Guix Services</li><li>POSIX Shell / ZSH Initialization</li></ul></div></div></div><footer><p>Website Created with <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html">Haunt</a></p></footer></body></html>
