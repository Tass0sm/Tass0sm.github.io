** Summary
I joined the OSU Game Creation Club this year. I started programming because I wanted to make games, and I want to try that again. I'll use it as an opportunity to learn about the graphics stack, common lisp, and the cool tools created by [[https://www.youtube.com/user/CBaggers][Chris Bagley]].

I've recently [[https://github.com/Tass0sm/tassos-guix/commit/539090c45782906562901b8460fe8b8e3e36a432][packaged]] skitter, cepl.skitter, cl-soil, dirt, dendrite, classimp, cepl.sdl2, and a few other projects necessary for playing with the [[https://github.com/cbaggers/cepl.examples][cepl.examples]] repo. Now I can play with OpenGL in common lisp and reprogram games on-the-fly, all inside of a reproducible environment!
