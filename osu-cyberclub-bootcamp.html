It is very well organized and
 provides some great resources for members. One of these is a set of capture the
 flag exercises covering reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web
 exploits, and cryptography. They're pretty fun. All the members of the club are
 ranked on a leaderboard, so it feels like playing a game. Right now I'm ranked
 at number 11, but I'm shooting for the top 5. Maybe I'll be able to attach
 results to this page at some point.</p><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><ul><li>Using Ghidra for reverse engineering binary executables.</li><li>Block cipher exploits and number theory for cryptography.</li></ul></div></div></div><footer><p>Website Created with <a href="https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html">Haunt</a></p></footer></body></html>
