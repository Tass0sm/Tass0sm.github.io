After seeing news about Alphafold2, I wanted to try playing with it and maybe
using it to predict the structure of a protein. Unfortunately, the Alphafold2
code was not available at the time, so I chose to play with <a href="https://github.com/dellacortelab/prospr/">ProSPr</a>. I eventually
completed that structure prediction after some troubleshooting, and I
contributed a small fix to the project along the way.
