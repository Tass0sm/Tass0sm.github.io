For a long time, I have wanted to store all of my email in a local
maildir on my machine, so I could index it, search it, and read it
with the tools I prefer to use. I haven't been able to do this because
mail clients that do this by default are forbidden by certain email
providers. However, Gnome Evolution is an allowed linux email client
for both my OSU and Purdue email accounts. See <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN/Support/KB/Docs/UsingEvolutionwithOff">here</a> and <a href="https://osu.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1929/ASC/KB/ArticleDet?ID=106081">here</a> for more
details on using Evolution at these organizations. After the accounts
are properly configured in Evolution, the mail can be automatically
fetched and copied to a local maildir using Evolution's filters. After
this, using this maildir is straight-forward.
