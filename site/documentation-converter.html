 while preserving structure. Currently, it has only been used to poorly convert
 the Common Lisp Hyperspec to Texinfo format.</p><p>The design is largely inspired by Pandoc. All documentation is structurally
 pretty similar. That structure can be summarized well by a graph or tree of
 seperate pieces of markup. This tool uses a function from a set of readers to
 parse this structure, converts the contained markup using Pandoc, and then
 produces a new structure of a different type using a function from a set of
 writers. The whole pipeline is formed by composing these functions.</p><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><ul><li>Purely Functional Programming in Haskell</li></ul></div></div><footer><p>This website was created using org-mode and haunt.
